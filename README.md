# Tanks
A top-down tank shooter game made using the Godot engine.

**How to play**: 
On Windows, go to %appdata%/Godot/app_userdata/Tanks and create 2 folders named Tanks and Maps; these two will contain all .pck mods.
Use the exe in the Runnable folder.

**Controllers**: 
Currently, there is no signed apk file; install the app using VS 2017 through USB.
In order to detect the computer, phones should be connected to the same WI-FI.
